#0 means, no problems here

#so if there is no number at exit, it will take the last instruction

#and check the number it uses, if its 0 since its not initialized,

# exit $? means to exit with the last variable

#two ways to run the bash program

#you have to do chmod +x bashex1.sh first no matter what

#first way is bash bashex1.sh

#second way is source bashex1.sh

#if you use source to build, take out exit, it exits the terminal
